# ByteHub 

**Version 0.0.0**

ByteHub is an open source error logging Rest API where integration into current projects will be seamless. 

1. Users sign up and create an account
2. Users get a personalized and secure URL
3. In their codebase, users will be able to send HTTP Post requests with any parameters they desire. 

ByteHub is still in early development and is in no way functional, secure, or reliable. Any feedback is very much appreciated.
